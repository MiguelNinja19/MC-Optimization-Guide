VFX Stack

Angelica isn't the only rendering performance mod for 1.7.10. There is another option, the so called "VFX Stack". It includes:
| Mod | Notes | Client/Server |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Beddium |	- |	Client
| FalseTweaks |	- |	Client
| LeafCulling |	- |	Client

There are pros and cons of using VFX Stack mods over Angelica:

Pros:

Beddium is based on a newer version of Sodium (0.5.11 vs 0.2), likely has better performance.
Better mod support
Better period-appropriate shader support (via SwanSong Shaders)

Cons:

No Sodium video settings UI (currently)
Requires additional mods to get the same functionality as Angelica (SwanSong Shaders, RightProperMCPatcher, NotFine and LeafCulling)

As for which one is better for you, try it and see.
